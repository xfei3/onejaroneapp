Just got an inspiration by spring boot. Spring boot allows the developer to pack entire application into a war file, then developer just needs to run a normal java command, it will start a server and host application. So I just packed some files for pentest, like webshell, http tunnel shell.

the source code will be uploaded later.

usage: java -jar resource.jar

one issue I haven`t solved is, you actually can change file extestion(.war) to any thing like .pdf, .jpg. Java will execute it. But you will not be able to locate jsp files. I think it is related to some path issues. Any one who solved it, please share.
